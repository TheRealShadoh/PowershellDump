# PowershellDump
Dump of powershell scripts, functions, tidbits from over the years.

Most of these scripts have been pulled out of archives, and aren't known to be out of the box working for generalized use. They should have been working in their environment.
At the time that they were created...which may be over 5 years ago. Feel free to improve the code if you use it, and PR back in. This this repo is to make it easier for us to find things we have done in the past.
and improve upon the methods we used when they're needed again. But not need to reinvent the wheel.

We've tried to scrub any identifying information out of the scripts, so you will need to correct paths, and setup your local environment.

## Read this
No promise that any of these work or are tested, they've been scrubbed but not all of them have been repaired post-scrub.

Old scripts, not following best practice. Use as a reference.
